# Building Tabular Surrogates With an Interactive Widget #

This directory contains a Jupyter Notebook that was used as a hands-on exercise
during the following events:

* [2021 BIAS Summer School][2021_bias-summer-school]; and
* [2021 TAILOR Summer School][2021_tailor-summer-school].

To run the notebook (`tabular_surrogate_builder.ipynb`) you need to install a
collection of Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file
(included in this directory) by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Alternatively, you can run it via Binder or Colab by clicking the buttons
