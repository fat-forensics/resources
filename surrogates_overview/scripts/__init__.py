Surrogate Explainability Overview
=================================

This small library implements a collection of helper functions for a range of
surrogate explainability methods.
Among others, it implements an image classifier based on PyTorch;
a surrogate explainer of image and tabular data; and
a collection of interactive iPyWidgets for no-code experiments with these
explainers.
See <https://github.com/fat-forensics/resources/tree/master/surrogates_overview>
for more details.
